A lot of people have asked us how we built this community web site and what technologies we used. 
So we decided to share our experience with others in a meetup. The following PPT outlines some of the requiremets and technologies we chose to use to build it - Github Pages, Jekyll, Disqus, Zendesk, Google custom search and others.

Enjoy and "(newwindow)let us know":https://cloudifysource.zendesk.com/forums/20583067-cloudify-development if you want more details.
