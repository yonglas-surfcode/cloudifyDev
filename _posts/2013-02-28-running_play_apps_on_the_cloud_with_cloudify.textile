When it comes to running Play Framework apps on the cloud, there are many great options; one of those options is Cloudify. 
Read "(newwindow)my post":http://blog.typesafe.com/running-play-apps-on-the-cloud-with-cloudify on the Typesafe blog about how developers can deploy their apps on the cloud with Cloudify. 
And there's a bonus - you can give the Play framework recipe a test drive using the all new Cloudify Player 
(just scroll down and hit the play button).
