Here's a short post that explains how to install Heat and DevStack on Vagrant


# Download and install "(newwindow)Vagrant":http://downloads.vagrantup.com (1.2.6).
# Download an "(newwindow)Ubuntu box":http://files.vagrantup.com/precise64.box for the vagrant and place it in your Vagrant folder.
# Download this Vagrantfile and place it in your Vagrant folder: 
<script src="https://gist.github.com/tamirko/6182702.js"></script>
# Start Vagrant and invoke the following commands:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*vagrant box add heat precise64.box*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*vagrant up*
# Ssh to the newly created vm by invoking *vagrant ssh default* or via putty (login to 172.16.0.2. Use "vagrant" for both user and password).
# In 172.16.0.2, invoke the following command to install Heat and DevStack on Vagrant:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/tamirko/6182746.js"></script>
