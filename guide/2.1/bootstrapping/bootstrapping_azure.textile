This topic provides instructions for bootstrapping Cloudify on Windows Azure.

h2. Prerequisites

Before you bootstrap your Windows Azure cloud, make sure that your environment meets all the minimum requirements. For more information, see "Bootstrapping Prerequisites":../bootstrapping/bootstrapping_process#prereqs and "Configuring Azure":../setup/configuring_azure.

h2. Bootstrapping

Bootstrapping on Windows Azure is a process where the Cloudify cloud driver on your machine interacts with the Windows Azure management API to create a new Azure deployment. Cloudify instructs Azure to perform the following tasks:
* Create a management role with the Cloudify controller components
* Create a webui role with the Cloudify web management console webserver
* Create worker roles for each application service according to your recipe

Currently, each application is deployed with its own Cloudify controller installation.

Bootstrapping the Windows Azure cloud is extremely simple, just follow the "bootstrapping":../bootstrapping/bootstrapping_process#boot procedure, typing the following command in step 2: "*@azure:bootstrap-app@*":https://gist.github.com/1695721.

The following example shows the command for bootstrapping the Cloudify controller and the Cloudify agents for the travel application (tomcat and cassandra roles): *@azure:bootstrap-app@* @-azure-pwd 123456 -azure-svc mytraveldemo c:/cloudify/examples/azure/travel@. Once the bootstrapping is completed, the Windows Azure management portal displays the roles in the *Hosted Services* view.

h2(#tear). Teardown

To shut down the Windows Azure environment, at the Cloudify shell prompt, type: *@azure:teardown-app@* @<appName>@

h4(info). This uninstalls applications and shuts down all the management and service instance machines.
