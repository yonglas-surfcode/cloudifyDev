This topic explains how to deploy your applications using Cloudify.

h2. Deploying your Application

Once your "application recipe":../developing/recipes_overview and its dependencies are ready, and you have "bootstrapped":../bootstrapping/bootstrapping_process your cloud, you can now deploy the application.

The following procedure describes the steps for deploying your application:
# Connect to the REST service--At the Cloudify shell prompt, type: *@connect@* @<RESTservice>@
# Deploy the application--At the Cloudify shell prompt, type: *@install-application@* @<appName>@

In the first stage of the deployment, Cloudify packages your recipe and uploads it to the Cloudify controller. Then, a fully-automated deployment takes place, exactly as described in the recipe. You can monitor the deployment progress in the following ways:
* "Cloudify shell":#monitor --During the deployment, progress information is displayed in the shell
* "Cloudify web management console":../monitoring/the_web_management_console --Once the deployment has completed, you can verify the installation using the *Application* view in the web management console.
* Review the installation logs

h2(#monitor). Monitoring your Deployment

In the Cloudify shell used to run your application deployment, you can monitor its progress using the following information displayed in the shell:

* The number of planned service instances as described in the application recipe and their interdependencies.
* Detailed progress about each service being deployed and started, including the <span style="color:green;">success</span> or <span style="color:red;">failure</span> of each lifecycle event run. Additionally, Cloudify plots a dot every two seconds to indicate the progress of the current action.

The following example shows the progress of a successful deployment of the PetClinic application.

In the event that a deployment fails to complete, Cloudify displays an error message in red.

The following examples shows the progress of a deployments that failed due to a recipe compilation error.

The following examples shows the progress of a deployments that failed because the application is already deployed.

h2. Undeploying

The following table lists the various commands for uninstalling all or part of an application and its environment.

|_. Command |_. Description |
| *@uninstall-service@* @serviceName@ | Uninstalls the specified service |
| *@uninstall-application@* @appName@ | Uninstalls all services and the specified application |
| *@teardown-localcloud@* | Uninstalls all services and the application, and shuts down all machines in a localcloud. For other clouds, use @teardown-cloud@ |
