h2(#q04). *Q: Can I remove a service after I deploy an application?*

 *A:* Yes. 
 <br/>
      Assuming that your service is called myServiceName:
	  Run the following command from Cloudify CLI: *uninstall-service myServiceName*

h2(#q05). *Q: Can I add a service after I deploy an application?*

 *A:* Yes. 
      Assuming that your service is called myServiceName and is located in /user/myApps/currApp/:
	  Run the following command from Cloudify CLI: *install-service /user/myApps/currApp/myServiceName*

h2(#q06). *Q: I deployed a Tomcat service and now I have a new WAR file.*
 *Do I need to re-install the whole application?*

 *A:* You don't need to re-install an application in order to update a WAR file.
In order to do that, when you install an application, you must add an "updateWar" custom command (in your recipe's custom commands section) to your recipe.
You can read more about custom commands "here":../developing/custom_commands .

h2(#q08). *Q: What is Cloudify's pricing?*

 *A:* Cloudify has a number of editions, one of which is completely free production usage, with no size limits. The other editions are paid editions, and differ from the free edition in that they include commercial support from GigaSpaces and premium features.  
 You can read about it "here":http://www.gigaspaces.com/cloudify-pricing

h2(#q09). *Q: What application stacks can I use?*

 *A:* Cloudify enables you to on-board any Application onto any Cloud.
 	We wanted to provide a flexible yet simple mechanism to deploy and manage applications on the cloud. But we also wanted it to be flexible enough to support any kind of application. In other words, we decided that our platform would support your application no matter what application stack you use (Java/Spring, Java EE, PHP, .NET, Ruby on Rails or others), whether you are using a relational (such as MySQL) or non-relational (e.g., Apache Cassandra) data store, or if you choose to add other middleware components. Regardless of your application set-up, you can still use Cloudify to... Cloudify it.

h2(#q11). *Q: Is Cloudify open source?*

 *A:* Most of Cloudify's components are open sourced. The sources can be found on "(newwindow)GitHub":https://github.com/CloudifySource/cloudify and are licensed under the "(newwindow)Apache2 license":http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0 .
Some parts of Cloudify are still not open sourced, but we plan to gradually open source most of them over the next few months.

h2(#q12). *Q: What does the test-recipe command do?*
*What is the difference between test-recipe and install-application?*

 *A:* The test-recipe enables you to test one service recipe of yours. <br/> 
      The test-recipe actually runs a service recipe (and all its lifecycle event handlers).<br/>
      It does NOT require a bootsrap, nor does it perform one, so obviously, it does NOT create a management machine.
<br/>
      P.S. : 
	   Currently Cloudify does NOT enable you test an application recipe, only a service recipe.

h2(#q13). *Q: Where will the serviceDirectory point to?*
*If I have two service instances.*
*Will the statement ${serviceContext.serviceDirectory} be identical for both them on localcloud?*

 *A:* No. 
 <br/>
      The ${serviceContext.serviceDirectory} is actually the instance's working directory.

    <br/>  Each instance has its own working directory on every cloud (public, private and localcloud).

    <br/>  Assuming that your application is named myApp and your service is named myService:<br/>
* *On localcloud:*
** The 1st instance's working directory will be &lt;Cloudify Root&gt;/work/processing-units/myApp_myService_1/ext 
** The second's will be &lt;Cloudify Root&gt;/work/processing-units/myApp_myService_2/ext.
* *On a real cloud:* 
** The 1st instance's working directory will be remoteDirectory/work/processing-units/myApp_myService_1/ext 
** The second's will be remoteDirectory/work/processing-units/myApp_myService_2/ext.<br/>

<h4 class="info"> Note that remoteDirectory should be set in the provider section in &lt;Cloudify Root&gt;/tools/cli/plugins/esc/YOUR_CLOUD_PROVIDER_NAME/YOUR_CLOUD_PROVIDER_NAME-cloud.groovy .</h4>

h2(#q14). *Q: Ant with proxy:*
 I am using AntBuilder in my install lifecycle event handler script and I need to get a resource from a url.
 I need a proxy with my http connection.
 How do I make it work ?

 *A:*
