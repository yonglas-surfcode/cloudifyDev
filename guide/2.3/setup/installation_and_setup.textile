Cloudify can run in your cloud environment out of the box. 
There is no need for any special integration. 
Below are the steps for setting your cloudify environment for any cloud provider.


h3. Download and Setup Cloudify

"Download":/downloads/get_cloudify Cloudify to your desktop.

h3. Setup Cloudify to work with your cloud provider account

To enable Cloudify to work &#34;under&#34; your cloud provider, you need to set Cloudify's cloud driver file that corresponds the cloud provider that you use.
In this cloud driver, you need to set your API key , SSH key information etc.

For example: 
Assuming that your cloud provider is Amazon EC2 : 
In your ec2-cloud.properties you need to set the following properties values:
user="ENTER_USER_HERE"
apiKey="ENTER_API_KEY_HERE"
keyFile="ENTER_KEY_FILE_HERE"
keyPair="ENTER_KEY_PAIR_HERE"

You can find more info about parameterization of the cloud driver configuration "here":../clouddrivers/cloud_driver#gstr.

The following is a list of supported cloud provider and their advanced configurations:

* "Amazon EC2":../setup/configuring_ec2
* "OpenStack Cloud":../setup/configuring_openstack
* "HP Cloud":../setup/configuring_hp
* "Azure (IaaS)":../setup/configuring_azure
* "RackSpace":../setup/configuring_rsopenstack
* "Any traditional data center [BYON]":../setup/configuring_byon


h4(impt). This step is done only once per cloud provider account. 
            
h3. Bootsrapping Cloudify on your cloud environment

Cloudify uses a "boostrapping process":../bootstrapping/bootstrapping_process to provision machines for Cloudify management, and machines for services required to deploy applications.
This step is often done once for all your applications' deployments.
You need to use Cloudify interactive shell for bootstrapping, installing applications and controlling your Cloudify environment.

h5. Steps

## Start the Cloudify shell on your desktop 
Go to <Cloudify home>/bin and start the Cloudify.sh or Cloudify.bat
## Bootsrap Cloudify management on your cloud provider
       Type <span class="snippet">boootsrap-cloud cloudProviderName</span> on your Cloudify shell.
	   Examples:
        For Amazon EC2, type :       <span class="snippet">boootsrap-cloud ec2</span>
        For HP OpenStack Cloud, type : <span class="snippet">boootsrap-cloud openstack</span>
## Manage your Cloudify environment 
Upon successful bootstrap, the URL of Cloudify's management console will be displayed. Browse the web UI URL to view your Cloudify environment as shown in the following image:

h3. Use your Cloudify environment

Once you've got your Cloudify environment up and running, you are ready to deploy your application. 
You can pick one of the demo applications located at &lt;Cloudify Home&gt;/recipes/apps/
To run the demo application type the following command in your Cloudify shell
   *install-application ../recipes/apps/petclinit-simple* (we use petclinic-simple in this example)
<img src="../../images/setup/cli_2_2.png" width="696" height="500" />
You can monitor the progress and state of the deployment in the Cloudify shell and in the management console.

h3. Cloudify your custom application

To deploy your custom application it's recommended to start with one of the existing recipes. You can choose a recipe from Cloudify github repository. If you already use "Chef":https://github.com/CloudifySource/cloudify-recipes/tree/master/apps/travel-chef or "Puppet":https://github.com/CloudifySource/cloudify-recipes/tree/master/apps/hello-puppet, you can use their cookbooks and configure it to run on Cloudify using the existing Chef or Puppet recipes.
You can easily customise those recipes for your environment by extending the recipes and overriding the relevant parts.
 If your application doesn't matche any of the existing recipes, you can use the steps which are described "here":../developing/recipes_overview to write your own custom recipe.
