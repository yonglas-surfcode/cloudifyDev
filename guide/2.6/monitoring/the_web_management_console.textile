This topic describes the web management console, and how explains how to use it.

h2. Overview

The web management console is deployed as a service when Cloudify is bootstrapped, and can be used to "verify and monitor":#verify, or "troubleshoot":#troubleshoot the deployment of an application.

h2. Anatomy

The web management console consists of the following views:
* *"Dashboard":#dashboard*--An overview of your grid and deployed applications
* *Applications*--Shows a graphical representation of your deployment plan as described in the recipe (visualized as connected application services), and the deployment status of each service. The view contains the following panels:
** *"Metrics":#metrics*--Metrics for the selected service
** *"Infrastructure":#infra*--Lists all machines and their services for the selected service
** *"Services":#services*--Lists all service instances of the selected service
** *"Logs":#logs*--Shows the log for the selected service
** *"Events":#events*--Shows the events for the selected service
** *"Recipes view":#recipes*-- Shows deployed recipe files for the selected service.
* *Services*--Shows detailed information for each service

h3(#dashboard). The Dashboard

The dashboard displays high-level information about your grid and deployed applications, and consists of the following sections:
* *Grid Status*--This section consists of the following areas:
** *Health*--An aggregated status of the entire Cloudify service grid based on alerts
** *Resources*--An aggregated view of CPU and memory utilization across the management and the application machines
* *Services*--This provides views per app, or for all apps, and consists of the following key areas:
** *Infrastructure*--A list of machines and their services, and their corresponding health
** *Application Services*--A list of application services and their corresponding health
<h4 class="info">You can toggle between applications by clicking the vertical tabs</h4>
* *Alerts*/*Events*--The lower pane serves as an console for alerts and events, depending on the selected view. Each row is an aggregate of a group of alerts or events.

h2(#verify). Verifying and Monitor Application Deployment

The *Application* view displays a graphical representation of your application deployment plan as described in the uploaded recipe, and visualized as connected application services. You can use this to verify that the deployment conforms to its recipe or monitor its health status, using the following:
* The application map of the deployment
* The status of each service in the deployment
* The number of service instances and other information for each service

h4(info). The service widget also enables you to perform actions.

The following show the application view and each of its panels:

h3(#metrics). Application view with Metrics panel

h3(#services). Application view with Services panel

h3(#logs). Application view with Logs panel

h3(#recipes). Application view with recipes viewer

h2(#troubleshoot). Troubleshooting an Application's Deployment

Using the *Application* view's *Logs* panel, you can trace deployment issues without leaving the web management console.

h2(#reverse-proxy). Running Via A Reverse Proxy

h4(impt). This feature is only available from Cloudify version 2.5.1

It is possible to set up a reverse proxy for the management console. This can be desirable e.g. when access to the Management Console is done via a gateway. Reverse proxy setups are currently available and tested only on the Apache web server.


h3. Configuring The Proxy

Enable the relevant modules, by uncommenting (or adding) the following lines inside @httpd.conf@:

<pre>
<code>
LoadModule  proxy_module         modules/mod_proxy.so
LoadModule  proxy_http_module    modules/mod_proxy_http.so
</code>
</pre>

Add your server's name, and define a virtual host for the configuration, where @gs.webui.com@ represents your server's DNS:

<pre>
<code>
NameVirtualHost *:80
<VirtualHost *:80>
	ServerName gs.webui.com
</VirtualHost>
</code>
</pre>


Create mappings to channel proxy paths (@webui-endpoint@ being the proxied path obsecuring the address of the Management Console):

<pre>
<code>
<VirtualHost *:80>
	...
	ProxyPass /webui-endpoint/ http://127.0.0.1:8099/ 
	ProxyPassReverse /webui-endpoint/ http://127.0.0.1:8099/
	RedirectMatch /login/index\.do /reverse-proxy-testing/login/index.do 
	ProxyPreserveHost on
</VirtualHost>
</code>
</pre>

Set a redirection rule for serving the login page:

<pre>
<code>
<VirtualHost *:80>
	...
	RedirectMatch /Gs_webui\.html /webui-endpoint/Gs_webui.html
</VirtualHost>
</code>
</pre>


h3. Debugging Your Proxy

You can dump logging information to custom files on the Apache server by adding the following rules:

<pre>
<code>
<VirtualHost *:80>
	...
	ErrorLog "logs/webui-error_log"
	CustomLog "logs/webui-access_log" common
</VirtualHost>
</code>
</pre>
