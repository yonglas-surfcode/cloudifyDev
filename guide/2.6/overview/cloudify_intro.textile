<p>Some of the main drivers for moving to the cloud include:</p>
<table class="overviewtable">
	<tr>
		<td valign="top"><img src="../../images/overview/Auto-Scale.jpg" style="margin-bottom: 0; width:35px;"/></td>
		<td valign="top">*On-demand Availability & Scalability* -- Scale your application resources to efficiently consume what you need now.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top"><img src="../../images/overview/agility.png" style="margin-bottom: 0; width:35px;"/></td>
		<td valign="top">*Rapid Deployment & Agility* -- Reduce the time to deploy your application by utilizing an agile process for provisioning compute resources.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top"><img src="../../images/overview/cost-reduction.png" style="margin-bottom: 0; width:35px;"/></td>
		<td valign="top">*Cost-reduction* -- Realize the cost benefits of procuring cloud compute resources without the overhead of system administrators.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<br />
And the objective is to realize these benefits without having to change your application or choice of stack, nor do you want to lose the ability to configure and fine-tune your application and its environment. However, using off-the-shelf clouds often requires you to compromise on one or more of the following objectives:
<ul>
	<li>*No Code Change* -- One of your primary objectives when moving to a cloud solution is to take your application and deploy it in the cloud without having to rewrite any of your code. This can be challenging enough if your application is not ready for an elastic, cloud-based deployment. It can be made significantly more difficult if the cloud's prepackaged images do not provide the versions of services on which your application depends, or may simply not provide the custom environment that your application requires.</li>
	<li>*No Lock-in* -- Another important objective is to have the flexibility to change cloud providers if the need arises. Therefore, if you have to customize your application to work in a specific cloud, this can make it difficult to move to one of the many emerging solution providers due to the complexities of migrating to a new architecture.</li>
	<li>*Full Control* -- And of course, you want to be in control of the environment in which your applications runs, to fine-tune, monitor, upgrade, and configure your resources in the cloud according to your needs, and not as dictated but by limiting environments that some clouds provide.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="cloudify">
So, what is Cloudify? And how can it help you achieve your objectives?
<br />
In a nutshell, Cloudify is an enterprise-class open source PaaS stack that sits between your application and your chosen cloud. It enables your application to concentrate on doing what it does best, leaving Cloudify to ensure that the resources it needs are available regardless of the cloud and stack used. Cloudify is designed to offer the following features:

<table class="overviewtable">
	<tr>
		<td valign="top"><img src="../../images/overview/any-stack.jpg"/></td>
		<td valign="top">*Any App, Any Stack* -- Move your application to the cloud without making any code changes, regardless of the application stack (Java/Spring, Java EE, Ruby on Rails, ...), database store (relational such as MySQL or non-relational such as Apache Cassandra), or any other middleware components it uses. This enables you to achieve your objective of _<span style="color:orange;">no code changes</span>_.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top"><img src="../../images/overview/Any-cloud.jpg"/></td>
		<td valign="top">*Any Cloud* -- Move your application to any cloud environment, from any environment, at any time. Cloudify supports public clouds (Amazon EC2, Windows Azure, Rackspace, ...) and private clouds (OpenStack, CloudStack, VMWare vCloud, Citrix XenServer, ...). Moreover, to support enterprises that want to deploy the same application in multiple environments (say, for cloud bursting), Cloudify's framework is designed to be flexible enough to handle any application stack, and yet on the other hand, isolate the application completely from the underlying cloud runtime. By hiding the APIs and configuration of a cloud from your application, your application can be easily moved from cloud to cloud. This enables you to achieve your objective of _<span style="color:orange;">no lock-in</span>_.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top"><img src="../../images/overview/Full-control.jpg"/></td>
		<td valign="top">*Full Control* -- Move your application confident in the knowledge that you are in full control of its environment. In many clouds, you lose at least some degree of control because the underlying infrastructure is not exposed to you, and hence you cannot monitor and fine-tune it as you are accustomed to doing with traditional data centers and applications. Because Cloudify does have access to the infrastructure, it provides a much greater level of control, but only if you actually want it. Otherwise, it hides their complexities using a set of predefined application blueprints and best practices, that users with less advanced requirements will typically find sufficient.</td>

<div id="how">
In contrast to "(newwindow)DevOps":http://www.cloudifysource.org/2012/05/28/paas_does_it_really_mean_no_ops.html tools that simply assist in installing your applications, Cloudify provides a mechanism to manage the entire lifecycle of your application. Built on proven technology (our mission-critical high-performance elastic application platform "(newwindow)GigaSpace XAP":http://www.gigaspaces.com/wiki), Cloudify uses recipes to describe an application, its services & their interdependencies, how to monitor, self-heal, and scale its services & their resources. As a result, deploying and managing your application becomes a simple process:

# Prepare your deployment
#* Set up your cloud and describe your machines in the cloud driver
#* Prepare the binaries required for your services
#* Describe the application lifecycle and its services in recipes
# Deploy the services and application
#* Provisions machines in your cloud using cloud drivers
#* Downloads, installs, and configures your services
#* Installs your application
#* Configures your monitoring and scaling features
# Monitor and manage the deployment using the Cloudify web management console or the Cloudify shell

<img src="../../images/overview/onboard.png" width="570px" />
This process is made possible by Cloudify's <a onclick="$('#pageTabs').tabs('select', '#architecture');">architecture</a> and enables you to achieve your objectives, as follows:
* *No Code Change* -- This is achieved using application recipes that describe the services and their dependencies.
<img src="../../images/overview/universal-service-agents.png" title="Built-In Recipes" width="545px"/>
* *No Lock-in* -- This is achieved by describing a @compute@ section a service's recipe that uses templates from the cloud driver configuration file. In this example, the service uses the *SMALL_LINUX* template that is described in both the OpenStack and Amazon EC2 cloud driver configuration files. Therefore, switching between the clouds is as simple as specifying which cloud driver file to use.
<img src="../../images/overview/no-lockin.png" title="Built-In Recipes" width="545px"/>
* *Full Control* -- This is achieved using the Cloudify web management console and the Cloudify shell. You can customize them by describing addition commands and monitors in the service recipe files. In this example, the *Total Requests Count* is described in the @monitors@ section of a service's recipe file.
<img src="../../images/overview/full-control.png" title="Built-In Recipes" width="545px"/>

And finally, to make setting up recipes and cloud driver configuration files even easier, Cloudify comes prepackaged with a variety of application and service recipe files, and cloud driver configuration files.

<div id="architecture">
Cloudify implements a layered architecture that hide the implementation details that enable the simple deployment process, as follows:
<img src="../../images/overview/architecture.png" width="570px" />

This architecture is made possible by Cloudify's Universal Service Adapters that are deployed to every Cloudify provisioned machine. These adapters perform the key feature that allows you to achieve your objectives (no code change, no lock-in, and full control) by translating simple recipes into actions (installation, service initialization, service monitoring, ...). What makes these adapters special is that they are service agnostic (Tomcat, MySQL, Cassandra, JBoss, Apache with mod_php, ...) and can therefore run any kind of service as long as its recipe is properly configured.

h4(info). Cloudify recipes are simple Groovy files that describe the execution plans for the lifecycle of the application (for installing, starting, orchestrating, and monitoring your application stack). The recipes use cloud drivers configuration files (that describe machines and their images for your chosen cloud) for provisioning machines for your services.

Using this architecture, you can write recipes describing all the components required to run your application, confident in the knowledge that Cloudify will handle all the details of implementing the environment.
