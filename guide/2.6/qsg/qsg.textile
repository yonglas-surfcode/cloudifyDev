On Linux:
<pre class='prettyprint'>gigaspaces-cloudify-2.6/bin $ ./cloudify.sh   </pre>On Windows:
<pre class='prettyprint'>gigaspaces-cloudify-2.6\bin $ cloudify.bat   </pre>

This will install Cloudify management,agent and UI on your machine.
<pre class='prettyprint'>cloudify@default> bootstrap-localcloud   </pre>

LOCAL-CLOUD INFO :
                CLOUDIFY MANAGEMENT     http://127.0.0.1:8099/
                CLOUDIFY GATEWAY        http://127.0.0.1:8100/

* *Go to the Web UI to see the cloud services* : "(newwindow)Cloudify web UI":http://127.0.0.1:8099
No username or password is necessary at this point.

h2. Deploy Application

The Hello World application presented in this guide is actually a @war@ file that's deployed on "(newwindow)Tomcat":http://tomcat.apache.org.

Now that the cloud is ready, let's deploy the application:
<pre class='prettyprint'>cloudify@default> install-application helloworld   </pre>

During the deployment, you can go again to the "(newwindow)Web UI":http://127.0.0.1:8099 and track the progress of your newborn application's deployment at *Applications->Select Application->helloworld*.
 
Once the application installation has successfully completed, you can access the *helloworld* at the following URL:  "(newwindow)http://127.0.0.1:8082/helloworld":http://127.0.0.1:8082/helloworld.

h2. Uninstall the Application

<pre class='prettyprint'>cloudify@default> uninstall-application helloworld   </pre>

h2. Teardown the Local Cloud

<pre class='prettyprint'>cloudify@default> teardown-localcloud   </pre>
