This topic provides instructions for configuring RackSpace Cloud for Cloudify.

h2. Prerequisites

* A "RackSpace Cloud":https://manage.rackspacecloud.com account
* Cloudify shell (for information about installing the Cloudify shell, see "Installing the Cloudify Shell":../setup/installing_the_cloudify_client)

h2. Configuring RackSpace Cloud

This section provides step-by-step instructions for the following configuration tasks:

# "Configure the Cloudify cloud driver configuration file":#driver
# "Enabling Wire Logging [Optional]":#log

h3(#driver). Configure the Cloudify cloud driver configuration file

Edit the RackSpace cloud driver configuration file (@rackspace-cloud.groovy@) located in the @<cloudifyRoot>/clouds/rackspace/@ folder, and modify the following attributes:
* In the *provider* section:
** *machineNamePrefix*--The value that you specify is used as the name prefix for each of your service instances.
** *managementOnlyFiles*--An array containing a list of files to copy to management machines and not agent machines. Use this list to specify files such as any credentials files required by the cloud driver.
** *managementGroup*--The value that you specify is used as the name prefix for each of your management instances.
* In the *user* section:
** *user*--Specify your *Username*.
** *apiKey*--Specify your corresponding *API Key*.
You can obtain your *Username* and *API Key* from the "(newwindow)API Access":https://manage.rackspacecloud.com/APIAccess.do section of the RackSpace web console, as follows:
!../../images/rs/api_access.jpg!
* In the *templates* section:  				 
** *imageId*--Specify the *RackSpace Install Image Id* (AMI).
** *hardwareId*--Specify the RackSpace *Machine Size*.

<br/>
For a list of Image Ids, at the ==*==nix shell prompt, run the following @rscurl@ command: 
*@rscurl.sh@ -u YOUR_RACKSPACE_USERNAME -a YOUR_RACKSPACE_API_KEY -c list-images*

For a list of Hardware Ids, at the ==*==nix shell prompt, run the following @rscurl@ command: 
*@rscurl.sh@ -u YOUR_RACKSPACE_USERNAME -a YOUR_RACKSPACE_API_KEY -c list-flavors*

For more information, see "(newwindow)rscurl: A Rackspace Cloud Server command line tool":http://www.lilbiker.com/2010/11/rscurl-rackspace-cloud-server-command.html.

The following is a list of RackSpace Hardware Ids:

|_. ID |_. RAM(M) |_. Disk(G) |_. Flavor Name |
|1 | 256 |10 |256 server |
|2 | 512 |20 |512 server |
|3 | 1024 |40 |1GB server |
|4 | 2048 |80 |2GB server |
|5 | 4096 |160 |4GB server |
|6 | 8192 |320 |8GB server |
|7 | 15872 |620 |15.5GB server |
|8 | 30720 |1200 |30GB server |

<h4 class="impt">For setting the cloud driver, we reccomend that you use "parameterization of the cloud driver configuration":../clouddrivers/cloud_driver#gstr, but you can also set the cloud driver directly as shown in the following example (of a @rackspace-cloud.groovy@ file):</h4>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/tamirko/5849472.js"></script>

h3(#log). Enabling Wire Logging [Optional]

For development and debugging purposes, it can be usefull to view the actual messages sent to the RackSpace cloud controller.
To configure logging, edit your @rackspace-cloud.groovy@, and then in the *custom* section, set the *openstack.wireLog* attribute to *true*.

The following example shows the *rackspace.wireLog* attribute set to *true*.
<script src="https://gist.github.com/3034554.js?file=rscustom-wireLog.groovy"></script>

h4(warn). Once you enable the wire logs, they appear in the Cloudify shell when you run the 'bootstrap-cloud' command (and the relevant log file in the logs folder), and in the ESM log when it starts or stops a machine for scale out/in.
