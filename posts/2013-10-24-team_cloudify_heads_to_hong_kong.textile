It's that time of year again for the OpenStack Summit, and the Cloudify team will soon be shipping out to Hong Kong to take part.

We've got a bunch of exciting announcements to make and a MONSTER giveaway going to one lucky winner at the event. From a new app catalog project with HP Public Cloud to providing a single platform with Nebula for creating your own OpenStack environment in a single day, we are excited to make some noise and fill you in on what we've been up to. All we can say is fasten your seatbelt and hold on tight ;)
