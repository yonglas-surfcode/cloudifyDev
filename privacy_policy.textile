 <h2>Introduction</h2>

We are committed to respecting your online privacy and recognize your need for appropriate protection and management of any personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") you share with us. 

"Personal Information" means any information that may be used, either alone or in combination with other information, to personally identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, personal profile, a home or other physical address, an email address or other contact information. 
</p>
<p>  
 <h2>Account</h2>

Currently, we do not require you to provide Personal Information in order to have access to information available on our Site. However, in order to provide you with certain services given through the Site, you must create an account ("Account").  We offer two ways to create an Account: 

<ul style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>Online Registration Form:  You can complete and submit an online registration form which we make available on the Site.  You will be asked to provide us with information such as your username, an email address, and a password that you will use for your Account.  </li>
<li>Third Party Account:  You can choose the option to sign in with a third party account as displayed on the login page for the Site such as: Facebook, Twitter, or another designated third party website (each a "Third Party Account").  Doing so will enable you to link your Site Account and your Third Party Account.  If you choose this option, then a Third Party Account pop-up box or window will appear requiring you to authorize the application’s use of your Third Party Account in order to proceed, and which will describe the permissions required and types of information that may be obtained from this authorization, and the types of activities that we may perform in connection with, your Third Party Account.  With some Third Party accounts you may also be asked to choose a Site username or associated email address that you will use in connection with your Account on our Site.  Please note that in order to use this option, you will need to have, and may need to sign-in to, an existing Third Party Account.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>  
 <h2>Publicly Available Information</h2>

Public Profile: If you have an Account you may, if you wish, add more information about yourself, such as profile pictures, your name, location and address ("Your Profile"). Your Profile will be publicly available to other Site users, and may also be accessed and used by people off of the Site.

User Submissions.  The Site may permit you and other Site users to post and publish images, pictures, photographs, drawings, illustrations, comments, messages, text, videos, and other content, onto public areas of the Site ("User Submissions").  You acknowledge and agree that these User Submissions will be publicly available to other Site users, and may also be accessed and used by people off of the Site even if such content contains Personal Information. 

Link between User Submissions and Public Profile.  Please note that some or all of your Public Profile may be displayed next to or in connection with your User Submissions.

Your Contact Information.  If you publish your contact information in a User Submission or as part of Your Profile, you may receive unsolicited messages from Site users or the public.  We therefore encourage you to only post information that you are sure you want to be accessible to anyone.
